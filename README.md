# Data Visualization Project

## Data

The data I propose to visualize for my project is Sleep Health and Lifestyle Dataset
- Here is the link of my Dataset:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uom190346a/sleep-health-and-lifestyle-dataset
This Dataset contains 13 attributes which are Person ID, Gender, Age, Occupation, Sleep Duration (hours/night), Quality of Sleep (1–10), Physical Activity Level, Stress Level (1–10), BMI Category, Blood Pressure (e.g., `126/83`), Heart Rate, Daily Steps, Sleep Disorder.


## Questions & Tasks

The following tasks and questions will drive the visualization and interaction decisions for this project:

- How does average sleep duration differ between low, medium, and high stress levels?
- Do males and females differ in sleep at each stress level?
- What is the relationship between sleep disorders and both stress and sleep duration?
- Which features (BMI category, physical activity, daily steps, heart rate) are most correlated with sleep duration?


## Sketches

(insert one or more hand-drawn sketches of interactive visualizations that you imagine)
(describe each sketch - how is the data visualized, what are the interactions, and how do these relate to the questions/tasks)

## Prototypes

I’ve created a proof of concept visualization of this data. It's a ... and it shows ...

(please put a screenshot of one or more visualizations of this dataset you already made, for previous assignments, and link to them)

You can put images into here by pasting them into issues.

You can make images into links like this:

Also, you can study the [source](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/curran/dataviz-project-template-proposal/master/README.md) to figure out Markdown formatting. You can use the GitHub built-in editor to edit the document.

## Open Questions

(describe any fear, uncertainty, or doubt you’re having about the feasibility of implementing the sketched system. For example, “I’m not sure where to get the geographic shapes to build a map from this data” or “I don’t know how to resolve the codes to meaningful names” … Feel free to delete this section if you’re confident.)

## Milestones

(for each week, estimate what would be accomplised)
