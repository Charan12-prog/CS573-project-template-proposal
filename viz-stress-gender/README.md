Week 12 — Finishing Touches (Polished Update)

This week I focused on final cleanup instead of adding new
charts. I updated the color scheme so “None” is a neutral
gray and both disorder categories (Insomnia + Sleep Apnea)
use related blues, which makes the healthy vs disordered
grouping clearer. I also improved the subtitle and axis
labels to mention the original 1–10 stress scale. A new View
dropdown was added (All categories / Disorders only) so
users can quickly focus on just Insomnia and Sleep Apnea. I
refined legend spacing, added a small legend note (“Healthy:
None · Disordered: Insomnia + Sleep Apnea”), and adjusted
layout so everything fits neatly on screen. Overall, the
chart is cleaner, easier to read, and highlights the
patterns much better.
